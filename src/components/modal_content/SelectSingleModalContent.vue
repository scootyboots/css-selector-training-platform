<h2>CSS Selector Training Platform - Skeleton</h2>

<p>This app was developed as an easily customizable app for training one's abilities with CSS selectors.</p>

<p>There are lots of great resources for learning CSS selectors out there (shout out to <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/" target="_blank">css-diner</a>), but this one is designed so you can customize the content to your particular use case.</p>

<p>Many people and organizations use CSS selectors to facilitate web scraping efforts, or for other Robotic Process Automation (RPA) related operations on the web.</p>

<p>Often the people tasked with writing these CSS selectors aren't developers and might be writing CSS selectors for the first time.</p>

<p>Maybe you scrape ecommerce data and want to train users on common formats and patterns used in ecommerce sites. Maybe you're only interested in scraping reddit and want to familiarize users with common classes and elements found there.</p>

<p>Here you will find some simple exercises to demonstrate how this app can be utilized.</p>
